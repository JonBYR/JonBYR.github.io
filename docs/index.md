# About Me
Hello, my name is Jonathan Byrne. I am a currently in the last year of my MComp Games Computing degree at the University of Lincoln and am interested in programming in C++, C#, Python and Java. I also have experience using Github and am currently learning Linux. I also have experience using the game engines Unity and Unreal and have particpated in game jams throught my studies at university. Below you will find some of the projects I have done at university and the links to their repositories, however the link to all of the repostories for my work [here](https://github.com/JonBYR).

# Projects

## Superformula-2024
![Superformula with parameters 3, 4.5, 10 and 10](/assets/SuperformulaWeb.png)

This project was done in my fourth year and used C++ to generate complex shapes using polar coordinates that are generated from a formula devised by Johan Gielis, which can be described in my depth [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superformula). In order to display this formula, SDL was used to render the complex shapes created and involved converting from polar coordinates to SDL coordinates. I'd like to also implement threading in this project to try and reduce the compilation time for more precise intervals of theta. [Repo](https://github.com/JonBYR/Superformula).

## Fractal Noise-2024

This project was a creation of fractal noise, which is multiple octaves of perlin noise stacked upon one another. This was done in my fourth year of university to refresh myself on perlin noise while also learning how to create more refined noise by using fractal patterns. This was done in C++ using the SFML library to display the fractal noise as this was more suited than SDL to render the results. [Repo](https://github.com/JonBYR/Fractal-Noise).

## Mandelbrot Set-2024

This project was the implementation of the mandelbrot set in my fourth year, a series of finite complex numbers that do not converge to infinity via the formula Zn+1 = Zn + C. When displayed on an argand diagram, it displays a fractal pattern as parts of the set look like smaller versions of the entire set. The complex numbers were done in C++ without the complex library to further understand how the set works and rendered in SDL. [Repo](https://github.com/JonBYR/MandelbrotSet).

## RGB Game Jam-2023
![Spelunky Type Game](/assets/RGBGameScreenshot.png)

This was a game created in Unity for a 24 hour game jam in my fourth year of university, with the theme of RGB. This was a solo project and aim was to better understand the algorithm behind the game Spelunky that caused the game to procedural generate it's levels, which was successfully achieved during the course of the game jam. Going forward I'd like to improve the AI of the enemy. [Repo](https://github.com/JonBYR/RGB-Game-Jam).

## 8 Hour Game Jam-2023

This was a game created in Unity in the fourth year of university and was another solo project. The main aim of this game was to understand how to change the post processing effects of Unity within a script. [Repo](https://github.com/JonBYR/8HourGameJam2023/tree/main).

## Year 3 Project-2023
![A screenshot of the Unity project showing a close up of a wstern](/assets/Year3Project.png)

This was my third year dissertation project, which involved looking at the most common shot sequences between different film genres and then mapping this common shot sequence into Unity, as a tool for those interested in film development to use to visualise what different shots would look like and to potentially suggest a shot sequence they could use for their own films, by extending the user interface of Unity itself. Note that this dissertation was made in Unity 2021.3.9f1. Issues were found running on later Unity versions. Going forward I would like to implement a machine learning model to generate the common shot sequence rather than a database system. The full dissertation can be downloaded [here](/assets/Year3ProjectPDF.pdf). [Repo](https://github.com/JonBYR/Year3Project).

## Roots Game-Year 3-2023
![A screenshot from the game made in a team](/assets/RootsGame.png)

This was done during Global Game Jam 2023 in a two person team, which achieved second place in the University and was done in my third year of university. This game involved experimenting with procedural content generation with an algorithm I had developed myself. In this game I also created scripts for a visible timer, level loading, camera perspective, instantiating new objects, seperate gamemodes, high scores, generating sprites and a pause menu. [Repo](https://github.com/JonBYR/RootsGame/tree/main).

## Game Programming Assignment-2022
![A screenshot from the game programming assignment](/assets/GameProgramming.png)

This was a module in my second year of university to create our own game engine using C++ and SDL, as well as creating our own game within this game engine. This assignment helped to further understand the use of pointers and memory management within game development as well as the components required in a game engine. [Repo](https://github.com/JonBYR/GameProgrammingAssignment).

## Roach Killer-2019
![Roach Killer](/assets/RoachKiller.png)

This was the first game jam that I participated in, which was in my first year of university. This was a 24 hour jam and was a solo project, but it helped me to understand the essential concepts in game development such as player and enemy movement and UI features such as menus. [Repo](https://github.com/JonBYR/Roach-Killer).
