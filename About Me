Hello, my name is Jonathan Byrne, I am currently in my final year of my MComp Games Computing degree at the University of Lincoln. Throughout my studies I have learnt how to use languages such as Python, C++, C# and Java as well as game engines
such as Unity and Unreal and even using SDL to create my own game engine. I am currently on track to recieve a Distinction at the end of my degree. I have participated in game jams throughout my time at uni as well as having an interest in programming
and visualising mathematical concepts. Please feel free to look through my current projects in the projects tab, as well as my code with each repository link.
